## System Architecture
The EventLink platform utilizes a modern web application stack designed for efficiency and performance.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- **Components**: shadcn/ui for consistent and accessible UI components.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React and TypeScript with Wouter for client-side routing.
