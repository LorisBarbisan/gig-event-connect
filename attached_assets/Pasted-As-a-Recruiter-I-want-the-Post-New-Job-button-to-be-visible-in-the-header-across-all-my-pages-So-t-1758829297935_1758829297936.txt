As a Recruiter
I want the “Post New Job” button to be visible in the header across all my pages
So that I can quickly create a new job post from anywhere in the platform without navigating back to the “My Jobs” tab.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
Button Placement & Visibility

 The “Post New Job” button remains in its original location under the “My Jobs” tab.

 A copy of the button is added to the header/navigation bar on all recruiter pages.

 The button is visible only when logged in as a recruiter.

 The button is not shown to freelancers or users not logged in.

Functionality

 Clicking the “Post New Job” button from any location opens the job posting form (same flow as current “My Jobs” tab button).

 The button behavior is consistent across all recruiter pages (Dashboard, Messages, Profile, etc.).

 The button is styled consistently with platform design standards (color, hover states, mobile responsiveness).

Accessibility

 The button is keyboard-accessible (tab navigation + Enter/Space triggers).

 The button has appropriate ARIA labels (e.g., aria-label="Post New Job").

Testing

 Verified on desktop and mobile views.

 Verified on all recruiter-only pages.

 Verified that freelancers never see the button.

🔨 Breakdown of Work / Approach
Backend

✅ No backend changes needed (the existing job posting functionality already exists).

Frontend

Identify Recruiter Header Component

Update recruiter-specific header template to include a “Post New Job” button.

Conditional Rendering

Add logic: render the button only if user.role === recruiter.

Routing

Ensure the button links to the existing job post creation page.

Styling

Match the existing button design (color, gradient, hover, disabled states).

Ensure responsiveness in the header on small screens (collapse into menu if needed).

QA / Testing Approach

Log in as recruiter → check “Post New Job” button is visible in header across all pages.

Log in as freelancer → confirm button does not appear.

Not logged in → confirm button does not appear.

Test mobile view → confirm button doesn’t break layout.

Click button from multiple pages → confirm always opens the job creation form.
