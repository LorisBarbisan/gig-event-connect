As a Platform Admin
I want all user data (profile details, documents, images, messages) erased when a user is deleted
So that the platform respects privacy laws, keeps data storage clean, and other users have a clear record that the account is no longer active.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
Profile Data Deletion

 When a user is deleted (by self-request or admin action), their entire profile data is permanently erased, including:

Personal info (name, email, bio, CV, etc.).

Uploaded files (CVs, documents, certifications).

Uploaded photos/images.

Job postings they created (if recruiter).

Applications they submitted (if freelancer).

 Data is deleted from both the database and file storage (e.g., AWS S3, Replit storage).

 Deletion is irreversible and logged in the admin audit log.

Messages & Conversations

 Conversations with the deleted user remain in the inbox of other participants.

 At the bottom of each conversation, a “Account Deleted” notification is added to mark the conclusion of the chat.

 Messages sent by the deleted user remain visible for historical context.

 The deleted user’s name/avatar is replaced with “Deleted User” in all conversations.

 Clicking on their profile link results in a “This account no longer exists” message.

Notifications

 Users who had active conversations with the deleted user receive a one-time notification:

“A user you were chatting with has deleted their account. The conversation has been closed.”

Compliance & Safety

 Deletion follows UK GDPR rules (right to be forgotten).

 All caches and backups are flagged for purge of that user’s data at next cleanup cycle.

Testing

 Delete test account → confirm profile is erased (no public trace).

 Check linked recruiters/freelancers → conversations end with “Account Deleted” tag.

 Confirm deleted user’s content (messages, files) no longer retrievable.

 Verify that historical conversations remain intact for other users.
