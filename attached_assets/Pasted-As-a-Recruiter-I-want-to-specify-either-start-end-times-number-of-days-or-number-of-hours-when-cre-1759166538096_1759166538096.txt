As a Recruiter
I want to specify either start/end times, number of days, or number of hours when creating a job
So that freelancers clearly understand the duration and schedule of the job before applying.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
Job Creation Form

 In the Create Job form, a new section “Job Duration” is added.

 Recruiter can choose one of three options (radio buttons or dropdown):

Start and End Time

Number of Days

Number of Hours

 Based on selection, the corresponding input fields are displayed:

Start & End Time → two time pickers.

Number of Days → numeric input field.

Number of Hours → numeric input field.

 Validation rules:

Start time must be before end time.

Number of days ≥ 1.

Number of hours ≥ 1.

 Recruiter cannot submit the form without entering valid data.

Job Details Page

 Selected duration option is displayed clearly on the job posting (e.g., “Start: 10:00 / End: 18:00” or “Duration: 3 Days”).

 Display formatting matches platform style guide.

Database & API

 Database updated to store duration fields:

durationType (time / days / hours).

startTime / endTime (if time option selected).

days (if days option selected).

hours (if hours option selected).

 API updated to handle new fields.

Testing

 Can create a job with start/end time → displays correctly.

 Can create a job with number of days → displays correctly.

 Can create a job with number of hours → displays correctly.

 Invalid inputs (negative numbers, missing values, end time before start time) block submission with error message.

 All job duration info displays correctly on job details and search results.
