User Story

Title: Password Reset via "Forgot Password" link

Story:
As a registered user, I want to reset my password through a secure “Forgot Password” link on the login page, so that I can regain access to my account if I forget my password.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
AC1 – Link Visibility

“Forgot Password?” link is displayed clearly below the login form.

Link is accessible on both desktop and mobile views.

Link follows accessibility standards (keyboard/tab navigation, screen readers).

AC2 – Link Click

When clicked, user is redirected to a Password Reset Request page.

Page contains a single input field for registered email address.

Page contains a submit button and a cancel/back to login link.

AC3 – Email Submission

If the field is empty → show error message: “Please enter your email address.”

If invalid email format → show error: “Please enter a valid email address.”

If email does not exist in the system → show generic message: “If this email is registered, you will receive a password reset link.” (to avoid data leaks).

If email exists → system generates a unique, time-limited (e.g., 1 hour) password reset token.

Token is stored securely in the database (hashed + expiration).

AC4 – Password Reset Email

Email subject: “Password Reset Request – [Platform Name]”.

Email includes:

User’s first name (if available).

Secure reset link: https://[domain]/reset-password/{token}.

Clear expiry warning: “This link will expire in 1 hour.”

Email sent via reliable SMTP/notification service (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES).

Email should NOT expose if account exists (same messaging for all).

AC5 – Reset Link

Clicking the reset link opens the Reset Password page.

Page has two fields: New Password + Confirm Password.

Password must follow platform policy (e.g., min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number).

If token expired/invalid → show error: “This link is invalid or expired. Please request a new password reset.”

AC6 – New Password Validation

If fields empty → show error.

If passwords don’t match → show error: “Passwords do not match.”

If new password = old password → reject with message: “New password cannot be the same as the old password.”

If valid → hash and store new password securely (bcrypt/argon2).

Token is invalidated immediately after use.

AC7 – Confirmation

After successful reset, system redirects user to Login page with confirmation banner: “Your password has been reset successfully. Please log in with your new password.”

Send confirmation email: “Your password was successfully reset. If this wasn’t you, contact support immediately.”

AC8 – Security

All reset pages served over HTTPS only.

Rate-limiting on reset requests (e.g., max 5 per hour per IP).

Audit log entry created for reset request & reset completion.

AC9 – UX Enhancements (Optional, future sprint)

Allow reset request by username as well as email.

Add captcha/recaptcha to prevent brute-force.

Allow “Show Password” toggle on password fields.

🏗 DoR (Definition of Ready)

Design mockups available for login page, reset request, and reset form.

SMTP/email service configured in dev/test environments.

Token management approach approved by Dev & Security team.

✅ DoD (Definition of Done)

All acceptance criteria met.

Unit & integration tests for token, email, and reset flow.

QA tested across browsers + mobile.

Security reviewed (token expiry, brute force prevention).
