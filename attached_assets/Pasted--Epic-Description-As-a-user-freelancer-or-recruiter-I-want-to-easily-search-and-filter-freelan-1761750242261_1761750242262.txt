Profile completeness (optional enhancement)

Sorting logic defined in backend query.

Option to expand with “Sort by” dropdown in later version.

Subtasks:

Add pagination system (backend + frontend).

Optimize DB queries with proper indexing.

Test performance with large dataset.

Implement basic result caching layer.

6️⃣ Story: Handle No Results and Errors Gracefully

As a user,
