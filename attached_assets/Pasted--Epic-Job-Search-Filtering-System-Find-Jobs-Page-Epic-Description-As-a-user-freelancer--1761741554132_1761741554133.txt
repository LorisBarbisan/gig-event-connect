🔍 Epic: Job Search & Filtering System (Find Jobs Page)
Epic Description:
As a user (freelancer), I want to easily search and filter job listings by relevant parameters such as keyword, location, and date, so that I can quickly find the most suitable opportunities.
Additionally, job posts that originate directly from EventLink (i.e., posted by recruiters within the platform) must always appear before externally sourced jobs in search results.
