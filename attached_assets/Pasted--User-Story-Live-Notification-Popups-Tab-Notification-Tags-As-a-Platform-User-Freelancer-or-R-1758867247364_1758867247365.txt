📌 User Story: Live Notification Popups + Tab Notification Tags

As a Platform User (Freelancer or Recruiter)
I want to receive live notification popups for new activity and see a notification tag at the top of relevant tabs with unseen updates
So that I can stay aware of important events in real time and easily locate where action is needed.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
Notification Popups (from previous story)

 All real-time events (messages, application updates, rating requests, etc.) trigger a popup notification with relevant details.

 Popup notifications disappear automatically after 5–7 seconds, unless hovered over.

 Popups are clickable and redirect to the relevant item (message thread, job, rating page).

 Notifications are also stored in the Notifications tab for later viewing.

Tab Notification Tags (New Requirement)

 Each main tab (Messages, Jobs, Notifications, Ratings, etc.) displays a badge/tag when unseen activity exists.

 Badge style:

Small circle or pill with number count (e.g., “3”).

Placed at the top-right corner of the tab name/icon.

 Badge updates in real time when new unseen events occur.

 When the user opens the tab and views the new items, the badge count decreases accordingly.

 If all new items are viewed, the badge disappears.

 Badges are role-specific:

Recruiters → Jobs, Applications, Messages, Ratings tabs.

Freelancers → Applications, Messages, Ratings tabs.

 Badge count is accurate across page reloads (persisted via database state).

Behavior & Data Integrity

 Tab notification badges sync with popup notifications (e.g., receiving a new message → both popup + “Messages” badge increment).

 If a notification is dismissed via popup but not viewed in its tab, the badge remains until user visits the tab.

 Notifications are marked as “seen” only when the related content is opened.

Testing

 Verified badge increments/decrements correctly for all event types.

 Verified badge updates in real time without page reload.

 Verified on desktop and mobile layouts (badges fit without breaking UI).

 Verified badge disappears after items are read.

🔨 Breakdown of Work / Approach
Backend

Notification Tracking

Add a seen/unseen state to notification records in the database.

Count unseen notifications per user and per tab category.

Badge API

Extend API to return unseen counts for each relevant tab.

Push count updates via WebSocket/Firebase in real time.

Frontend

Popup Notifications

Implement toast notifications (done as per prior story).

Tab Badge Component

Create reusable badge (red circle/pill with number).

Integrate into tab navigation for recruiters and freelancers.

Sync with Backend

Subscribe to unseen count updates from backend.

Update badges dynamically without reload.

Clear counts when user views the tab content.

QA / Testing Approach

Send test events → verify popup + badge both appear.

Open related tab → confirm badge decreases/disappears.

Log out/log in → badge count persists correctly.

Stress test with multiple unseen items (e.g., 50+ messages).

Verify badge display works across browsers/devices.
