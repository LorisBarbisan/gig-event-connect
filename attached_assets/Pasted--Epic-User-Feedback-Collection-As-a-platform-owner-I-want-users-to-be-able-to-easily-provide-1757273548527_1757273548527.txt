📌 Epic: User Feedback Collection
As a platform owner,
I want users to be able to easily provide feedback from anywhere on the site,
So that I can collect suggestions, identify malfunctions, and improve the platform experience.

User Story 1: Feedback Link in Header
As a user,
I want a “Feedback” link in the header of every page,
So that I can submit feedback at any time without searching for it.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	A “Feedback” link is present in the header of all pages.
•	Clicking the link opens the feedback form in a modal or separate page.
•	The link is always visible, regardless of login status.

User Story 2: Pop-up Feedback Prompt
As a user,
I want to be occasionally prompted with a pop-up asking for feedback,
So that I am reminded to share my experience while using the platform.
Acceptance Criteria:
•	After browsing for at least 3 minutes and visiting 3 different pages, a feedback pop-up is shown.
•	The pop-up contains the same feedback form as the header link.
•	The pop-up can be dismissed without submitting feedback.

User Story 4: Feedback Submission
As a user,
I want my feedback to be submitted and sent via email to the platform owner,
So that my issues or ideas reach the right person.

o	Feedback type (from dropdown)

⚙️ Technical Implementation Breakdown
1. Frontend (Feedback Form & Links)
•	Header Link
o	Place a “Feedback” button in the site’s global header.
o	Clicking it triggers a modal with the feedback form (recommended for smooth UX).
•	Feedback Pop-up Prompt
o	Implement a session-based timer:
	Trigger after 3 minutes of activity + 3 page loads.
	Ensure the pop-up shows only once per session.
o	Store dismissal/submission state in session storage (to prevent repeat prompts).
•	Feedback Form Fields
o	Dropdown: Malfunction, Feature Missing, Suggestion, Other.
o	Required textarea for message input.
o	Submit + Cancel/Close buttons.
o	Lightweight validation (required fields).

2. Backend (Feedback Processing & Email Sending)
•	API Endpoint
o	Create POST /api/feedback endpoint.
o	Accepts:
o	{
o	  "feedbackType": "Suggestion",
o	  "message": "I’d love to see a dark mode option!",
o	  "userId": "12345", // optional
o	  "pageUrl": "/jobs/23",
o	  "timestamp": "2025-09-05T12:34:56Z"
o	}
•	Email Delivery
o	Integrate with an email service provider (cheap & reliable options):
	SendGrid (free tier: 100 emails/day).
	Mailgun (free tier for devs).
	Postmark (focuses on transactional emails).
	Or plain SMTP (Gmail/Outlook SMTP, but limited and less reliable).
o	Email subject format:
o	[Feedback: <FeedbackType>] from <UserID or Guest>
o	Email body format:
o	Feedback Type: Suggestion
o	Message: I’d love to see a dark mode option!
o	User: 12345 (logged in) or Guest
o	Page: /jobs/23
o	Timestamp: 2025-09-05 12:34 UTC
o	Recipient: loris.barbisan@outlook.com

3. Non-Logged-In Users
•	If userId is missing, mark as Guest User.
•	Capture IP address (optional, GDPR caution).
•	No authentication required for the feedback endpoint.
________________________________________
4. Error Handling
•	If email sending fails:
o	Return 500 error.
o	Show user message: “Something went wrong. Please try again later.”
•	Log error for monitoring (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar).
________________________________________
5. Analytics Integration (Optional but Powerful)
•	Track feedback submission events in Google Analytics / Mixpanel.
•	Metrics:
o	Submission rate.
o	Feedback type distribution.
o	Logged-in vs guest feedback.
________________________________________
6. Security & Anti-Spam Measures
•	Add a rate limit (e.g., max 3 feedback submissions per user per hour).
•	Add lightweight CAPTCHA (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA v3) if spam becomes an issue.
•	Validate input server-side (avoid injection attacks).

🚀 Suggested Tech Stack
•	Frontend:
o	Modal form built in React / Vue / Vanilla JS.
o	Session handling with sessionStorage.
•	Backend:
o	Node.js (Express) / Python (Flask/Django) / PHP (Laravel).
o	Email service via SendGrid / Mailgun.
•	Storage (optional, future):
o	Save feedback submissions in DB (Postgres/MongoDB) for analytics & trend tracking.
o	Not mandatory if email-only is enough at MVP stage.
