Epic: Job Search Functionality

As a job seeker,
I want to search for jobs using keywords, filters, and contract types,
So that I can quickly find relevant opportunities.

User Story 1: Keyword Search (Jobs, Companies, Skills)

As a user,
I want to enter keywords in the search bar,
So that I can find jobs by job title, company name, or listed skills.

Acceptance Criteria:

 When a user enters text and clicks "Search", results are returned that match:

Job title (partial or full match).

Company name.

Listed skills.

 Search is case-insensitive.

 Results show even if only a partial match exists (e.g., "Tech" → "Technician").

 If no results are found, a message displays: “No jobs match your search.”

User Story 2: Location Filter (UK Only)

As a user,
I want to filter results by UK location,
So that I can find jobs near where I want to work.

Acceptance Criteria:

 The search page includes a location filter limited to UK cities/regions.

 When a location is selected, only jobs in that location are displayed.

 If multiple locations are selected, jobs matching any of them are shown.

 If no location is selected, jobs from all UK locations are shown.

User Story 3: Contract Type Filter

As a user,
I want to filter by contract type,
So that I can find jobs with the work arrangement I prefer.

Acceptance Criteria:

 A dropdown menu is available with contract types (e.g., Freelance, Part-Time, Full-Time, Temporary).

 When a contract type is selected, only jobs matching that contract type appear.

 If no contract type is selected, all contract types are displayed.

 Multiple filters (e.g., keywords + location + contract type) can be combined.

User Story 4: Displaying Search Results

As a user,
I want to see the search results clearly listed,
So that I can review opportunities quickly and easily.

Acceptance Criteria:

 Search results display in a structured list or card format.

 Each result shows at minimum:

Job title

Company name

Location

Contract type

 Clicking a job opens the detailed job description page.

 Results update dynamically (without full page reload if AJAX/React is used).

 Pagination or lazy loading is implemented if results exceed a set number (e.g., 20 per page).

User Story 5: Combined Filters & Search Persistence

As a user,
I want to combine filters (keywords, location, contract type),
So that I get the most relevant results.

Acceptance Criteria:

 The system applies all selected filters together.

 Results are narrowed progressively as filters are added.

 Search input and filter selections remain visible after results load.

 A "Clear Filters" button resets the search form and reloads all jobs.
